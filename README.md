The player starts with $100 dollars in chips and any bets placed will be taken from this pool, conversely, any winnings will be added to this pool. Once tahe player places a bet, the dealer deals out the cards, two face up to the player and one face up with one face down to the dealer. The player is the prompted as to whether they would like to *hit* or *stand*, by entering 'h' or 's' respectively. If the player *hits* they receive another card face up, if they *stand*, the dealer reveals and hits until 17. At that point the game is decided and the better hand wins. Lastly, the player has the option to keep playing with their current pool of bets, by entering 'y' or 'n'.
